# Bookmarker

`Pinterest + Pocket = Bookmarker`

This app didn't need to be built, but I did it anyway. I wanted a solution that was tailor fitted to me, as well as an excuse to experiment with some new technologies.

- I was looking for something simple to help me save articles and videos for later consumption, just like [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/).
- As a web developer, I was also looking for something to help me curate of all documentation, app/tools, and open source code that I find useful. I realized I was describing [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) boards.

## Installing Bookmarker

Bookmarker is a Progressive Web App (PWA) you can install on your phone just by visiting the website.

1. Go to [https://bookmarker.site](https://bookmarker.site) on your mobile phone.
2. You will be prompted to add Bookmarker to your home screen. Do it.

Once added to the Home screen, the app will be "installed" and Bookmarker will become a "Share Target" on your phone. Now anytime you are reading an article you want to save for later, you can share it to Bookmarker.

## Using the Bookmarker

- When you add a new bookmark url, Bookmarker will automatically attempt to pull in the title, description, and image for that url
- You place bookmarks in a "Collection" (like a folder). These collections are what show on your home screen.
- You can tag your bookmarks, then click a tag to see all bookmarks with that tag

## Maybe someday

1. Chome Extension so you can quickly bookmark links when on your computer.
2. Improve the search experience so it is easier to find the bookmark you are looking for.
